Preprocessed DEAP mat files and DEAP.ced are required for ICADEAP.m
 -> which will create ICA components and back-project them to the channel
 -> They will be stored as .set with .fdt files
Then run .set with SETtoMAT.m to take the EEG Channel data
 -> which will be used to generate ImageData
 -> They will be stored as .mat files

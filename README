This is computed using recurrence plot and currently abandoned due to no significant improvement.
However, maybe with LSTM and GAN could improve the accuracy

Preprocessed DEAP mat files and DEAP.ced are required for ICADEAP.m
 -> which will create ICA components and back-project them to the channel
 -> They will be stored as .set with .fdt files
Then run .set with SETtoMAT.m to take the EEG Channel data
 -> which will be used to generate ImageData
 -> They will be stored as .mat files
